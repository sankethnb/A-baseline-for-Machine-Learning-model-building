# A-baseline-for-Machine-Learning-model-building
I realized what is really needed for any aspiring/eastablished Data scientist is a model building workflow which they can readily use while working on any project. As a Masters student here at University of South Florida, there were many times while I was working on projects where I needed to go back and forth to find what next??

I am writing this notebook which can be used as a ready reckoner using a real world world data set, where I will be walking through solving a complete model building workflow.

The main objective of this project is to show how all the different data science practices come together to form a complete project. I have focussed more on the implementations of the methods rather than explaining them at a low-level.
